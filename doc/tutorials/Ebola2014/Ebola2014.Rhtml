        <h3>The Outbreak</h3>
          <p>
          The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa is an ongoing public health crisis, which has killed hundreds of people so far. The cross-border nature of this epidemic, which has emerged in Gunea, Liberia and Sierra Leone has complicated mitigation efforts, as has the poor health infrastructure in the region. While there has been much analysis and speculation about the factors at play in the spread of the virus, there aren't many specific predicitons about the expected duration and severity of this particular epidemic. In the (certainly temporary) absence of peer reivewed epidemic forecasts, let's make some!
          </p>
          <a id="intro-data-sect" class="anchor"></a>
        <h3>The Data</h3>
        <p>
        A summary of the WHO case reports is very helpfully compiled on wikipedia for analysts who are too lazy to read the case reports themselves.  Let's read it in with the xml library.

<p>
These represent cumulative counts, but because case reports can be revised downward due to non-Ebola illnesses the graphs are not monotone. If someone would hire an intern to read all the case reports and compile their best guess as to actual case infection times, that would be pretty awesome. Instead, let's just "un-cumulate"* the data and bound it at zero to get a rough estimate of new case counts over time.

      <h3>Compartmental Models</h3>
      <a id="intro-compartment-sect" class="anchor"></a>
      <p>
        Now that we've got data read in and made a couple pretty plots, let's do some compartmental epidemic modeling. Not only has Ebola been <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17156292">well modeled in the past</a>
        using compartmental modeling techniques, but this author happens to be working on a software library to fit compartmental models in the spatial SEIRS family. What a strange coincidence! Specifically, we'll be using heirarchical Bayesian estimation methods to fit a spatial SEIR model to the data.  
        <br/>
        
        While a full treatment of this field of epidemic modeling is (far) beyond the scope of this writing, the basic idea is pretty intuitive. In order to come up with a simplified model of a disease process, discrete disease states (aka, compartments) are defined. The most common of these are S, E, I, and R which stand for:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>S</strong>usceptible to a particular disease</li>
        <li><strong>E</strong>xposed and infected, but not yet infectious</li>
        <li><strong>I</strong>nfectious and capable of transmitting the disease</li>
        <li><strong>R</strong>emoved or recovered</li>
      </ul>
  <p>
    This sequence traversed by members of a population (S to E to I to R) forms what we might call the temporal process model of our analysis. This analysis belongs to the stochastic part of the compartmental modeling family (which has its roots in deterministic systems of ordinary and partial differential equations), the transitions between these compartments occurs according to unknown probabilities. It is the S to E probability, which captures infection activity, into which we introduce spatial structure. Some details of this are given as comments to the code below, and more information than you probably want on the statistical particulars is available in <a href="https://github.com/grantbrown/libspatialSEIR/blob/master/doc/models/SEIR_Algo.pdf">this pdf document</a>. For now, suffice it to say that we'll place a simple spatial structure on the epidemic process which simply allows disease to spread between the three nations involved, and we'll try to estimate the strength of that relationship. <br/>
In addition, we're not going to do anything fancy with demographic information or public health intervention dates. Although we certainly could, this <i>is</i> a quick and dirty analysis. In the interest of simplicity, we'll simply fit a different disease intensity parameter for each of the countries, as well as a set of basis functions to capture the temporal trend.

      <h3>Set Up</h3>
  <p>
    There are some initial things we need to define before we run off fitting models. 
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The time points are not evenly spaced so we need to define appropriate offset values.</li>
    <li>We must define the distance matrix which describes the spatial correlation structure.</li>
    <li>A set of basis functions needs to be chosen to capture the temporal trend.</li>
    <li>Prior parameters and parameter staring values must be specified for each chain.</li>
    <li>A whole bunch of bookkeeping stuff for which I haven't yet programmed sensible default behavior needs to be defined.</li>
