This software is the focus of my dissertation work, and as such is under heavy development. It is full of jagged edges, changing API's, and broken things. More than anything else, I haven't yet gotten around to using it on any platform save linux, so there are almost certainly problems on other platforms. Version 1.0 is planned for Spring 2015 and will include cross platform support, and hopefully a CRAN friendly distribution. In the meantime, I'm happy to <a href="https://github.com/grantbrown/libspatialSEIR/issues">respond to questions here.</a>

<a name="libspatialseir" class="anchor" href="#libspatialseir"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><h3>libspatialSEIR</h3>

<p>libspatialSEIR is a C++/OpenCL based framework for fitting Bayesian spatial SEIR and SEIRS compartmental epidemic models.
The numerical heavy lifting is all done in C++ with the optional use of OpenCL calls to multi-core CPU's and 
GPU's to accelerate computation. The primary interface is provided via the included R package, which uses the Rcpp 
library to access the lower level C++ API. </p>

<p>The R and C++ API's for libspatialSEIR are under heavy development, so documentation is a bit limited. 
For an introduction to the underlying C++ structure, <a href="http://grantbrown.github.io/libspatialSEIR_DoxygenMirror/html/classes.html">doxygen class summaries</a> are available. Perhaps 
the best current example of libspatialSEIR use from R is given by the <a href="./doc/tutorials/Ebola2014/Ebola2014.html">spatial SEIR Ebola tutorial</a>
addressing the current outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. 
</p>

<p>Additional example R code is available in the /scripts directory on the main branch.  </p>

<h3>
<a name="dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h3>

<p>While a CRAN friendly version of libspatialSEIR is tentatively planned, the project currently requires some prerequisites:</p>

<ol>
<li>Git</li>
<li>CMake</li>
<li>An appropriate C++ compiler </li>
<li>Boost random &gt;= 1.4.9 </li>
<li>R &gt;= 3.0</li>
<li>A BLAS capable library</li>
</ol>
In addition, if you would like to enable OpenCL support, you must install the appropriate OpenCL SDK for your hardware. This 
will also require that you tweak the CMakeLists.txt file present in the project root directory.

<h3>
<a name="installation-nix" class="anchor" href="#installation-nix"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h3>
<p>The most up to date installation information is available on the <a href="https://github.com/grantbrown/libspatialSEIR/wiki/Installation">libspatialSEIR wiki</a>

So far I've only used the software on Linux (Ubuntu/Mint), but installation instructions for Windows and OSX are planned. 
</p>


<p>That should be it, though as previously mentioned this is still very much a work in progress. Assuming it worked, you could try out some of
the example scripts. </p>

<pre><code>    cd ../scripts
    R
    &gt; source("./singleLocationTest.R")
</code></pre>
