This software is the focus of my dissertation work, and as such is under heavy development. It is full of jagged edges, changing API's, and broken things. More than anything else, I haven't yet gotten around to using it on any platform save linux, so there are almost certainly problems on other platforms. Version 1.0 is planned for Spring 2015 and will include cross platform support, and hopefully a CRAN friendly distribution. In the meantime, I'm happy to <a href="https://github.com/grantbrown/libspatialSEIR/issues">respond to questions here.</a>

<a name="libspatialseir" class="anchor" href="#libspatialseir"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><h3>libspatialSEIR</h3>

<p>libspatialSEIR is a C++/OpenCL based framework for fitting Bayesian spatial SEIR and SEIRS compartmental epidemic models.
The numerical heavy lifting is all done in C++ with the optional use of OpenCL calls to multi-core CPU's and 
GPU's to accelerate computation. The primary interface is provided via the included R package, which uses the Rcpp 
library to access the lower level C++ API. </p>

<p>The R and C++ API's for libspatialSEIR are under heavy development, so documentation is a bit limited. 
For an introduction to the underlying C++ structure, <a href="./doc/html/classes.html">doxygen class summaries</a> are available. Perhaps 
the best current example of libspatialSEIR use from R is given by the <a href="./doc/tutorials/Ebola2014/Ebola2014.html">spatial SEIR Ebola tutorial</a>
addressing the current outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. 
</p>

<p>Additional example R code is available in the /scripts directory on the main branch.  </p>

<h3>
<a name="dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h3>

<p>While a CRAN friendly version of libspatialSEIR is tentatively planned, the project currently requires some prerequisites:</p>

<ol>
<li>Git</li>
<li>CMake</li>
<li>An appropriate C++ compiler </li>
<li>Boost random &gt;= 1.4.9 </li>
<li>R &gt;= 3.0</li>
<li>A BLAS capable library</li>
</ol>
In addition, if you would like to enable OpenCL support, you must install the appropriate OpenCL SDK for your hardware. This 
will also require that you tweak the CMakeLists.txt file present in the project root directory.

<h3>
<a name="installation-nix" class="anchor" href="#installation-nix"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation - Linux</h3>

<p>The installation process is still very much in "development" mode. As of now, it has only been tested on Linux Mint, but similar instructions 
should apply for other platforms. After installing the appropriate pre-requisites, clone a copy of the repository. In order to make sure you 
get a copy of the embedded version of clBLAS (if you're using OpenCL) and Eigen3 (no matter what), be sure to clone the repository recursively:</p>

<pre><code>    git clone https://github.com/grantbrown/libspatialSEIR.git --recursive
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have a copy of the code, the easiest way to install the library is to run the install script in the R/release_package folder:</p>

<pre><code>    
    cd R 
    cd release_package
    ./install.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming this step completed correctly, you're ready to use the library from R. Should you wish to contribute to the development of the
C++ library, it's probably better to use the "dev_package" instead:
</p>


<pre><code>   
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install

    cd ../R
    R CMD INSTALL dev_package

</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to re-build the C++ shared library without re-compiling the R package (unless you make API changes, in which case both need to be 
re-compiled). Thi process may also be useful for troubleshooting errors encountered in the build process. </p>

<a name="installation-win" class="anchor" href="#installation-win"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation - Windows</h3>

<p>I'm currently working on getting a good build process for Windows, and plan to eventually release pre-compiled binaries. In the meantime, if you happen to be a CMake wizard, you should probably be able t adapt the above steps to suit your needs. </p>

<a name="installation-osx" class="anchor" href="#installation-osx"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation - OSX</h3>

<p>Without access to an OSX machine, I can't troubleshoot the install process. This is planned for the future, though as a unix-alike the build
process should closely resemble that of linux machines. </p>



<p>That should be it, though as previously mentioned this is still very much a work in progress. Assuming it worked, you could try out some of
the example scripts. </p>

<pre><code>    cd ../scripts
    R
    &gt; source("./singleLocationTest.R")
</code></pre>
