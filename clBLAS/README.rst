clBLAS
=======

Main Goal: include embedded version of the clBLAS project for distribution with libSpatialSEIR. 
Intermediate Stopgap: link to a built version of clBLAS with CMake, copy build files here for inclusion, linking, and local install.  

clBLAS is available at: 
https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clBLAS
