\title{
A fast framework for fitting Bayesian spatial SEIR models. 
}
\description{
Compartmental epidemic models are flexible and intuitive tools for
modeling the temporal evolution of epidemics, and can be easily extended to 
the spatio-temporal world. On the other hand, the computational burden grows 
greatly for large, or highly interconnected, spatial domains. This package 
aims to provide a fast method of fitting such models by shifting as much 
of the computational burden as possible to graphics processors using OpenCL.
