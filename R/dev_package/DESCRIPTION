Description: Compartmental epidemic models are flexible and intuitive tools for
  modeling the temporal evolution of epidemics, and can be easily extended to 
  the spatio-temporal world. On the other hand, the computational burden grows 
  greatly for large, or highly interconnected, spatial domains. This package 
  aims to provide a fast method of fitting such models by shifting as much 
  of the computational burden as possible to graphics processors using OpenCL.
